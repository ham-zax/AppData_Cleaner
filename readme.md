# AppData Cleanup Toolkit

PowerShell scripts that help reclaim disk space by identifying and removing orphaned folders in the `AppData\Local` and `AppData\Roaming` directories. The interactive workflow is safe-by-default and guides you through every deletion, while a legacy automation script remains available for power users.

## üéØ Highlights

- Scans both AppData roots for folders left behind by uninstalled software
- Cross-references fuzzy matches against installed programs and Windows Store apps
- Ships with an extensive whitelist to guard system and common vendor folders
- Provides interactive selection, deletion previews, and detailed logs
- Works entirely with standard user permissions‚Äîno elevation required

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

- Windows 10 or Windows 11 (or equivalent Windows Server build)
- PowerShell 5.1 or later (preinstalled on supported systems)
- Standard user rights (script touches only your user profile)

## üì¶ Scripts at a Glance

| Script | Purpose | Best For |
|--------|---------|----------|
| `Clean-AppData_interactive.ps1` | Interactive cleanup with menu-driven selection and optional auto-delete mode | Day-to-day manual cleanups |
| `Clean-AppData.old.ps1` | Non-interactive (WhatIf/Confirm) cleanup kept for backwards compatibility or automation | Scheduled tasks / power users |

## üöÄ Quick Start (Interactive Script)

1. **Download** `Clean-AppData_interactive.ps1` to a safe directory, e.g. `E:\My Documents\AppData_Cleaner`.
2. **Open** a non-admin PowerShell window and change to that folder:
   ```powershell
   cd "E:\My Documents\AppData_Cleaner"
   ```
3. **Adjust execution policy** if you have not previously enabled script execution:
   ```powershell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser RemoteSigned
   ```
4. **Run the interactive scan** (default mode):
   ```powershell
   .\Clean-AppData_interactive.ps1
   ```
5. **Review the menu**:
   - Toggle individual folders by typing their number
   - Use `A` (select all), `N` (select none), `S` (show selection)
   - Type `D` then confirm with `DELETE` to remove the selected folders

The script saves a log named `AppDataCleanup_yyyyMMdd_HHmmss.log` in your user profile directory (e.g. `C:\Users\YourName`). Each entry records success/failure and folder sizes for easy auditing.

## üîß Parameter Reference (`Clean-AppData_interactive.ps1`)

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `-MinSizeMB` | Double | `1` | Minimum folder size (in MB) to consider during scanning |
| `-AdditionalWhitelist` | String[] | `@()` | Custom folder names to permanently protect (case-insensitive) |
| `-AutoDelete` | Switch | `False` | Skips the menu and deletes every orphaned folder found (dangerous‚Äîreview logs first) |

### Auto-delete example

```powershell
.\Clean-AppData_interactive.ps1 -MinSizeMB 50 -AutoDelete
```

Use this mode only after validating the results interactively; it removes every candidate without prompting.

## üß≠ Interactive Workflow Notes

- All folders start **selected** for deletion to speed up review.
- Selections persist until you confirm or quit, enabling batch toggling.
- The script computes both estimated reclaimed size and the actual delta in free space on drive `C:` to highlight discrepancies caused by other system activity.

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Features

1. **Extensive Whitelist** ‚Äì 40+ protected vendors and system folders (Microsoft, NVIDIA, Steam, Adobe, Logitech, etc.) plus anything you pass through `-AdditionalWhitelist`.
2. **Size Threshold** ‚Äì Ignores folders under `1 MB` unless you lower the threshold.
3. **Fuzzy Matching** ‚Äì Bidirectional wildcard and word-level matching catches common naming differences between folders and installed programs.
4. **Interactive Confirmation** ‚Äì Default mode requires explicit confirmation before deletions occur.
5. **Comprehensive Logging** ‚Äì Every scan writes timestamped details (folders scanned, skipped reasons, deletions, failures) to the log file.

## üß∞ Legacy Automation Script (`Clean-AppData.old.ps1`)

The original script remains available when you prefer PowerShell‚Äôs native `-WhatIf` / `-Confirm` semantics or need to embed the cleanup into scheduled jobs. Key usage patterns:

```powershell
# Dry run preview
.\Clean-AppData.old.ps1 -WhatIf

# Verbose output with confirmation prompts
.\Clean-AppData.old.ps1 -Verbose -Confirm

# Focus on large folders and log details
.\Clean-AppData.old.ps1 -MinSizeMB 100 -Verbose -WhatIf
```

> **Tip:** The old script writes logs to your Desktop by default and honours `SupportsShouldProcess`, making it convenient for automation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Resolution |
|---------|------------|
| *Execution policy error* | Run `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser RemoteSigned` |
| *Access denied deleting folder* | Close apps using that folder or rerun later; entries remain in the log |
| *Many unexpected folders flagged* | Increase `-MinSizeMB`, use `-Verbose`, or extend the whitelist |
| *Strange characters in console* | Force UTF-8 output: ` [Console]::OutputEncoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8 ` |
| *Actual space freed shows 0* | Another process may consume space simultaneously; rely on calculated freed space column |

## üîÑ Version History

- **v2.1** ‚Äì New interactive menu, optional auto-delete switch, log saved to user profile root, enhanced statistics.
- **v2.0** ‚Äì Bidirectional fuzzy matching, expanded whitelist, Windows Store app detection, improved logging.
- **v1.x** ‚Äì Original non-interactive script (now archived as `Clean-AppData.old.ps1`).

Happy cleaning! üßπ
